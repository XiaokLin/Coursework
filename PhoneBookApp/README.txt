Welcome to the Phone Book Application. 

Notes:

    We did not seperate this into different folders for each exercise because it would have mess up the mapping on the hashmap. 

Running the code:

    To get started, you MUST complile MethodsLibrary.java. 
    You MAY not have to compile the other files for this to run but it will NOT run without the library folder compliled. 

    Compile with "javac -d . lib/*.java" and what ever else you want to compile. 

User Guide:

    The first bootup will also load into Admin view. 
    There will only be one Admin account. 
    Once done setting up as an Admin, exit and register as an User. 

We acknowledge that there are some fundamental differences between the method signatures requested in HW7 and our code. This was done purely to accommodate our use of a Hashmap instead of a .txt file

    All of this below is used for trying to get the hashmap to be saved onto a json file.
    Alot of time was spent on their github documentation.
